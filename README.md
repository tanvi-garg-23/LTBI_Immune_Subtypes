LTBI Immune Subtypes Analysis

This repository contains scripts used for analysing the immune subtypes of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) using RNA-seq data. The study investigates the progression from LTBI to active tuberculosis (ATB), aiming to identify distinct immune subtypes and potential biomarkers. The repository includes data preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis,  single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Consensus clustering, and pathway enrichment analyses.

Scripts and Branches
Main Branch: Centralized code for data acquisition, processing, and analysis.
Pathway Analysis Branch: Contains scripts for pathway enrichment analysis using the clusterProfiler R package and visualization using ggplot2 .
ssGSEA Branch: Implements single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) for exploring gene set enrichment across individual samples .
Clustering Branch: Scripts for unsupervised clustering of LTBI subtypes based on gene expression profiles and enrichment results .
